The intuition behind fused operators is that the original two operations cna be done now in one pass of the data reducing the need for storing and reloading intermediate results from memory, thereby decrease the number of memory access times and computation.
For instance, by fusing a matrix multiplication with a subsequent layer normalization or softmax, the intermediate matrix does not need to be written to main memory before applying the next operation. This reduces memory bandwidth usage, minimizes kernel launch overhead, and improves cache utilizationâ€”all of which contribute to enhanced performance, especially in deep-learning models that perform these operations repeatedly.
Future improvements could include tiling strategies and loop unrolling to further exploit data locality and parallelism.
